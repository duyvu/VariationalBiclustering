# VariationalBiclustering

This Java project implements many MM variational algorithms for biclustering models of binary, count, and real-valued responses.

The research paper corresponding to this project was published in Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, Volume 89, 12 - 24. The draft paper was stored in the directory **papers**.

Due to size, only two data sets and results of **MovieLens 100K** and **UC-Irvine Forum** mentioned in the paper are included in this repository.
